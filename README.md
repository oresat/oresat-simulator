# oresat-simulator

The goal is to receive data (the outputs from a Basilisk simulation or similar) 
repeatedly via socket and then transmit that data repeatedly over serial port
to the Helmholtz Cage and Solar Simulator.

sock_ser_model contains the current server/client model. Everything else is an archive or precursor program.

# Running the server and client
WORK IN PROGRESS
use sudo for the server, not needed for the client
run gtkterm -p /dev/ttyUSB1 or equivalent
